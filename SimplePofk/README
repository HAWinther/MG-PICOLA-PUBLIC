Simple code(s) to extract power-spectrum from simulation data 

SimplePofk         -> OpenMP version for matter P(k)
SimplePofk_MPI     -> MPI version for matter P(k)
SimplePofk_RSD_MPI -> MPI version for redshift space multipoles P0(k), P2(k) and P4(k)

OpenMP version accepts GADGET1, RAMSES and ASCII input files
MPI version so far accepts GADGET1 and ASCII

calcPofkSimple is a script to more easily run the [SimplePofk] version.
Just compile and set path to executable

Very hacky GADGET IO routines. No endian check etc. 
Should be fixed to proper routines at some point!
